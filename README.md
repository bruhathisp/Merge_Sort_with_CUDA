## CUDA Parallel Merge Sort Implementation

**Problem Scenario:**
The program implements a parallel merge sort algorithm using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), which is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA. The objective is to efficiently sort multiple sets of data arrays using GPU parallelism, leveraging CUDA's ability to perform computations in parallel across multiple threads.

**Key Components and Actions:**
1. **Data Initialization and Sorting:**
   - Two arrays (`host_array1` and `host_array2`) of size `DSIZE * NUM_SETS` are initialized with random integers.
   - These arrays are sorted using the Thrust library's `thrust::sort` function, which is optimized for GPU acceleration.

2. **CUDA Kernels for Merge Operations:**
   - **Row-Major Merge Kernel (`row_major_merge`):** This kernel merges pairs of sorted arrays (`device_array1` and `device_array2`) row by row.
     - Each thread handles a portion of the arrays, ensuring parallel execution across the GPU.
     - The merged result is stored in `device_result`.

   - **Column-Major Merge Kernel (`column_major_merge`):** This kernel merges the same arrays, but column by column.
     - It transposes the data to facilitate column-major merge operations, useful in scenarios where data access patterns are column-oriented.
     - The merged result is stored in `device_result`.

3. **Validation and Performance Measurement:**
   - **Validation Functions (`validate_row_major` and `validate_column_major`):** These functions compare the results of the GPU merges (`host_result` and `host_result_col`) with CPU-validated results to ensure correctness.
     - If discrepancies are found, error messages are printed, indicating a validation failure.

   - **Time Measurement:** Execution times (`cpu_time` and `gpu_time`) are measured using `time_usec` function to compare CPU and GPU performance.
     - CPU time measures the time taken for CPU-based merge validation.
     - GPU time measures the time taken for GPU-based merge operations.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the measured execution times (`CPU time`, `GPU row-major time`, and `GPU column-major time`) in seconds.
   - Successful execution without validation failures indicates that the CUDA parallel merge sort implementation is correct and performs as expected.
